### Users backend
Developed in a DDD and clean arquitecture way.

You can find the api documentation to run with postman in https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3002715/TVev4QY8

### App 
Developed with Vue.

It was my first approach into Vue world, so I tried to not introduce many component to reduce complexity

### How to run
In a real environment I don't build the module inside docker building, but I'm doing it to make it easier to run..

From root folder, run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now, you can access the app in http://localhost
